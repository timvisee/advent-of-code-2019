# Advent of Code 2019 in Rust
My [Advent of Code 2019][aoc-2019] solutions in the Rust programming language.
This repository holds a separate Rust project for each day and part.

This year I attempt to develop a short, compact and fast solution for each
problem.

[aoc-2019]: https://adventofcode.com/2019

## Run solutions
Each Rust project contains a `input.txt` file, holding the puzzle input. Simply
run the project to see the solution appear.

```bash
# Switch to day 4a, and run it
cd day04a
cargo run --release
```
